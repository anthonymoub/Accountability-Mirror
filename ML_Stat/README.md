# ML Cheat sheet

This document keeps track of the ML concepts i review on a daily basis (continuously being updated):

### Day 1:

1. Gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent
2. Model Bias and Variance and the Bias Variance tradeoff
3. Overfitting and how Lasso and Ridge (L1 and L2 regularization parameters) are ways to deal with it.
4. L1 can take coefficients to 0, unlike L2 which does not, which is why L1 is considered a stricter regularization parameter.
